# System Notes

This repository documents persistent system-level workarounds, hardware quirks,
and architectural decisions for a Linux workstation.

The goal is not exhaustive documentation, but **state awareness**:
- what is non-default
- why it exists
- how to remove or replace it

No identifying information is included.
# Workarounds Inventory

This file lists persistent workarounds that survive reboot
or materially alter system behaviour.

## Display / GPU

- **Disable DPMS**
  - Method: X11 autostart entry
  - Reason: Prevents display sleep/wake issues on this hardware
  - Status: Active

- **Forced display resolution**
  - Method: X11 autostart entry
  - Reason: Monitor EDID / handshake instability
  - Status: Active

- **GPU fan behaviour**
  - Hardware: NVIDIA GPU with unstable low-RPM fan region
  - Symptom: Fan hunting below ~35% PWM
  - Resolution: Minimum fan curve enforced via GreenWithEnvy
  - Status: Active (script-based workaround deprecated)

## Network

- **Wake-on-LAN**
  - Interfaces: Enabled on selected NICs
  - Intentional: Yes
  - Status: Active

## Storage

- **Swap**
  - Method: Host-owned swapfile
  - Reason: Eliminate dependency on legacy Windows disks
  - Status: Active
# System Architecture

## Host OS
- Linux as the sole boot owner
- No dependency on removable or legacy disks
- Swapfile owned by host OS

## Windows Strategy
- No dual-boot
- Windows to be deployed as a virtual machine
- VM storage isolated on a dedicated SSD
- Windows treated as disposable / optional

## Rationale
This architecture removes:
- boot ambiguity
- firmware entanglement
- shared storage coupling
- long-lived Windows state issues

The host OS remains the protected environment.
# Design Decisions

## Retired
- Dual-boot Windows (reason: complexity, state leakage)
- Script-based GPU fan enforcement (reason: poor visibility)

## Promoted
- GPU fan control → GreenWithEnvy (persistent, visible, adjustable)

## Accepted
- X11 autostart fixes for display behaviour
- Wake-on-LAN where explicitly required

## Principle
One authority per concern.
If a workaround persists, it must be either:
- visible via a UI, or
- explicitly documented.
