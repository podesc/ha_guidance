# System State & Workarounds

This document records persistent, non-default system behaviours and
architectural decisions for two Linux hosts.

Purpose:
- make implicit state explicit
- reduce rediscovery cost
- avoid folklore fixes

No identifying information is included.

---

## Host Encoding

- **White** = AIU22 (white case)
- **Black** = FUB22 (black case)

Encoding is intentional to avoid name/IP leakage in a public repo.

---

## Shared Architectural Principles

- Linux is the sole boot owner
- No dual-boot Windows
- Windows (when present) runs only as a VM
- Host swap is file-based and host-owned
- One authority per concern (UI > script > note)

---

## Black (FUB22)

### Display / GPU

- **DPMS disabled**
  - Method: X11 autostart entry
  - Reason: Prevents sleep/wake instability
  - Status: Active

- **Forced display resolution**
  - Method: X11 autostart entry
  - Reason: Monitor EDID / handshake issues
  - Status: Active

- **GPU fan behaviour**
  - Hardware: NVIDIA GPU with unstable low-RPM region
  - Symptom: Fan hunting below ~35% PWM
  - Resolution: Enforced minimum fan curve via GreenWithEnvy
  - Status: Active
  - Note: Script-based workaround deprecated and removed

### Storage

- **Swap**
  - Method: `/swapfile`
  - Reason: Remove dependency on legacy Windows disks
  - Status: Active

### Network

- **Wake-on-LAN**
  - Interfaces: Enabled on selected NICs
  - Intentional: Yes
  - Status: Active

## White (AIU22)

*(Intentionally sparse; only persistent deviations from default should be listed)*

---

## Retired / Avoided Patterns

- Dual-boot Windows
- Firmware-level fan control hacks
- Persistent background scripts without visibility

---

## Operating Principle

If a workaround:
- survives reboot, or
- affects hardware behaviour

…it must be either:
- visible via a UI, or
- explicitly recorded here.

Ephemeral fixes do not belong in this document.
